One of the many things that I think is a little bit odd about the current age of social media is the practice of deleting old content. Whether this be on a popular social media platform or even on a personal log, like what you're reading right now, there seems to be some acceptance for content deletion.

Which I don't know if I completely understand.

People will spend hours upon hours editing a video. They'll devote so much time crafting the right words for their essay. They'll agonize over every single thing before releasing it to the world.

Only to delete it days, weeks, or even years later.

I can understand someone no long standing by their previous words. Maybe they've grown as a person or been exposed to a new perspective. People are allowed to change their minds, after all, and not be held to their past selves for all eternity.

What I can't understand is deleting something that I poured so much time and energy into. Walking away, yes. Perhaps even updating. But to completely erase it off the face of the Internet, though it's true that nothing is every truly gone on the Internet, so no one can look at your own private shame?

I mean, I suppose I do understand after a fashion. Ultimately, everything we do on social media is for public consumption and somewhat performative by its very nature, even the act of deleting old content. But why not keep the old content up and offer an addendum or update if you've changed your mind? Show the progression you've made over the years.

Why delete history? It seems very strange.
