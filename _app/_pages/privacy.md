That's why I use Fathom Analytics for the website's analytics, which doesn't use cookies and complies with the GDPR, ePrivacy (including PECR), COPPA and CCPA. Using this privacy-friendly website analytics software, your IP address is only briefly processed, and I have no way of identifying you. As per the CCPA, your personal information is de-identified. You can read more about this on [Fathom Analytics' website](https://usefathom.com/compliance).

The purpose of using this software is to understand the website's traffic in the most privacy-friendly way possible so that I can continually improve my website and business. The lawful basis as per the GDPR is "f); where our legitimate interests are to improve our website and business continually." As per the explanation, no personal data is stored over time.
