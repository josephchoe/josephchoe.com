  	Hello!
  </h2>

  <p>
    I develop autonomous, evented services in Ruby. I very occasionally write
    fantasy and science fiction. I try to improve my mind by extensive reading.
  </p>

  <h2>
    What am I doing now?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Rather than working on a brilliant new idea, I'm developing my own skills,
    not only in programming but also operations work.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am learning <a href="https://mruby.org/">MRuby</a>. I'm not sure
    what I'll use it for, but it's pretty neat stuff.
