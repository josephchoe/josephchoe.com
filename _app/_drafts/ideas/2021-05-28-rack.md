Rack is a web server interface that nearly all Ruby web framework architectures use under the hood, including Rails, Sinatra, Roda, and many others. And yet not many Ruby developers know how to develop for Rack.

Yet its API is quite simple.

```ruby
class Application
  def call(env)
    [200, {"Content-Type" => "text/html"}, ["Hello, world!"]]
  end
end
```

One of the many reasons I develop in Rack is the simplicity of its API. I'm the kind of developer who likes code to be explicit. With web frameworks like Rails, the mechanics of the web like headers and HTTP response status codes are obfuscated from the developer. Much better, I think, to leave these open and transparent, though I suppose this may increase the amount of boilerplate code.
