Homelabs are one of those things that quickly spiral out of control.

For the longest time, my "homelab" consisted solely my laptop, a moderately recent MacBook Pro. I did everything on this computer, including watching movies, browsing the Internet, and of course software development.

About a decade ago, I used to build my computers. However, the constant need for maintenance and upgrade quickly diminished my tolerance for the finicky nature of building computers.

Still, it was quickly becoming clear that the laptop was on its last legs. Couple that with the knowledge that Apple constantly monitors your telemetry, and I needed to look for a better way.
