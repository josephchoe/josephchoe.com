  <p><em>The Memory Thief</em>, part of the <em>Thirteen Witches</em> series, was written by <a href="https://jodilynnanderson.com">Jodi Lynn Anderson</a>. It is simply an amazing story. I read this book in late May, but I thought I’d share it now since I was thinking about it.</p>

<p>Because I’m currently writing a middle grade portal fantasy, I try to read a lot of middle grade in my spare time. I was strolling around my local bookstore and was struck by the great cover. I immediately purchased it after reading the blurb and went home to read it.</p>

<p>It has honestly been a long while since I read something that affected me so deeply and emotionally. It’s also been a very long time since I’ve read through a book so fast, it was that good.</p>

<p>Here are some thoughts I wrote down at the time in my notes:</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the themes of memory and the loss of it and how it affects us. There’s also the idea of a distant parental figure and how it can deeply move us in ineffable and unshakeable ways, and I really related to that theme in the book. How the truth of things and the lies in between can be melded together to form something even more powerful.</p>

<p>Jodi Lynn Anderson’s language is so musical and powerful and can twist and turn it in ways that are so unexpected, yet feels completely right.</p>

<p>I hope I can one day write something so impactful.</p>
