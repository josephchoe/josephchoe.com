I decided to purchase another watch for myself. I've had my eye on the Omega Speedmaster Professional for many long years now.

I even got a watch box to hold my now growing collection.

Everyone seems to know its history as the first watch worn on the moon. Omega certainly never lets you forget it either.

<div class="gallery">
{% include gallery-image.html src="assets/posts/2023-01-24-speedmaster/first.jpg" %}
{% include gallery-image.html src="assets/posts/2023-01-24-speedmaster/second.jpg" %}
{% include gallery-image.html src="assets/posts/2023-01-24-speedmaster/third.jpg" %}
</div>

I put the Speedmaster on a leather strap, rather than use the bracelet, as I'm not too fond of metal edges. It has a hefty weight to it already though, which I like.

The *tick-tick-ticking* sound of the mechanical watch is a delight. It's become something of a daily ritual to wind it up every morning.
