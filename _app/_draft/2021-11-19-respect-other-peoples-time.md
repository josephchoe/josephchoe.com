A lot of the time, companies will be incredibly vague about what to expect during the interview process. They'll schedule an interview, technical assessment, or phone screen. Maybe you're feeling pretty good after the interaction. But then you wait. And wait.

And wait.

It's only then that the company will come back and ask you to come in for yet another interview.

This is why it's better to have an interview process that's clear and precise. Who are you going to interview and when? How much time can you expect the interview to take?

What's even worse is when the interviewer arrives late. I find this to be pretty egregious, especially because when the situations are reversed, it is almost always used against you.

That's why I keep a log of each interview process and how late everyone is to the interviews. If too many people are late and by a large amount of time, I terminate the interview process immediately. It's just a huge signal about the kind of company they are.
