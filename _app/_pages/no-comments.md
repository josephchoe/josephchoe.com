I'm not a big fan of internet comments, at least in their current form. I don't really think discussion is possible in a forum as limited as the comments section of a personal log or on Twitter or some other social link aggregation site like Reddit.

And while I don't imagine myself to be super popular, somehow needing a team of moderators to wade through the vast sea of comments, even the slightest bit of overhead is just a bit *too* daunting.

Therefore, I have no comments whatsoever.

## Responses

If you have a response to something I've written on my website, feel free to go ahead and send me a link to a post you've written in reply, preferably on your personal log or website. If I have something else to say in response to your response, I might write something and link back to it on the original post.
