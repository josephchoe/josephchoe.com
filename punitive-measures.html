  <p>Facebook’s little mishap this week prompted the joke that some poor network engineer might be getting fired for mishandling a configuration file.</p>

<p>But in truth, I hope not.</p>

<p>It recalled to mind all the times I’ve seen companies use punitive measures when things go wrong, and every single time it’s been the completely wrong decision.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>A massive outage is usually not the fault or responsibility of a single engineer. In truth, such systems are built by many different people over long periods of time. There should be a multitude of checks and automated systems and redundancies and failovers, all to make sure these things don’t happen.</p>

<p>If a lone engineer can become a single point of failure for such a system, <em>the error was inherent in the system anyway</em>.</p>

<p>To punish an engineer or team because of a systemic or process flaw is missing the point. Rather, the company should have an honest accounting of how such a failure occurred and ensure it never happens again.</p>

<p>Punishing the so-called engineers responsible only encourages a culture of fear and CYA. It inevitably leads to worse technical organizations.</p>
