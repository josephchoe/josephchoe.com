Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days

      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Jane Doe
Email address: jane@example.com
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Jane Doe <jane@example.com>"


Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
