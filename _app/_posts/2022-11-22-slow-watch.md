My wife gifted me a [slow watch](https://slow-watches.com/product/slow-round-12/) a few weeks ago.

Today is actually the anniversary of our first date. We've been together for eight years now, and I hope we have many more years ahead of us.

</div>

I've had my eye on the slow watch for more than a few years. It's actually one of the few watches that made me consider going back to wearing the things, as I haven't owned one since I was in high school.

I like the single hand that sweeps across the whole watch face, with marks denoting only 15 minute increments. Fuzzy time is something I use in my computers as well, rather than having to know the time down to the exact second or minute.
