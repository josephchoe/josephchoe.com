  	Hello!
  </h2>

  <p>
    I develop autonomous, evented services in Ruby. I very occasionally write
    fantasy and science fiction. I try to improve my mind by extensive reading.
  </p>

  <h2>
    What am I doing now?
  </h2>

  <p>
    I am developing Doorman, an application to build private, disposable email
    addresses. It's not a new idea, but I want to try to put my own spin on it.
    I figure I will learn a lot from the experience, in any case.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am also learning <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>. I think the Composition API is pretty neat.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Contact me
  </h2>

  <p>
    I am not often in the habit of handing out my email address on the Internet.
    Instead, if you need to reach me, I am <a href="https://twitter.com/josephchoe">@josephchoe</a> on Twitter.
