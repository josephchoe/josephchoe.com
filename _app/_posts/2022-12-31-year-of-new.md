[Last year]({% post_url 2021-12-31-year-of-writing%}) I compiled a list of resolutions I'd had for the year. I thought I'd do it again this year.

My main theme of the year was to try and do new things that were a little outside of my comfort zone. One of those things was to start using my new Framework laptop as my daily driver machine. I think on this front I was successful. I use this little machine for email, development, finance, and most of my tasks.

I didn't really take up a new language. I certainly tried! But after a few months, it didn't really fit what I wanted to concentrate on for the year, so I decided to focus on other things.

I think the biggest and most consequential thing I did for the year was to [complete my book](https://theimpossiblechildren.com/2022/07/09/book-1). It was the first time I ever completed an entire book from beginning to end. Not only did I complete the first draft, I also completed the second! I think this year was a complete success in terms of the year's theme.

## Next Year

I'm not really sure what I want to do next year or what theme I want to explore. I'd like to revisit learning a language at some point. I'm probably going to continue completing my book, polishing it up, and seeing what comes of that process. I've been posting videos again after a several month hiatus. But these are all separate things with no overarching theme to tie them all together.

And perhaps that's okay. I seem to start the year off with a few disparate ideas. Sometimes I do those things, sometimes I don't. It's not a big deal if I don't. We'll see what the year brings.
