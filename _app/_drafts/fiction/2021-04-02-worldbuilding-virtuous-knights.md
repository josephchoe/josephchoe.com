I've spent a lot of time writing about technical and professional subjects. But I have different interests, and I'm not just interested in writing technical essays.

So since April is a five-Friday month, I thought it might be interesting to devote four of those Fridays to writing fiction. The last Friday of the month will still be for my regularly scheduled sequence on Event Sourcing, so be sure to check that out!

Like many amateur would-be writers, I'm far more interested in the worldbuilding than in writing. With that in mind, I'll be going over a few different settings for fantasy and science fiction stories that have been rolling around inside my brain for the last few years.

I don't imagine they will appeal to many people, and I don't have any plans to develop these ideas further. But I'm glad to finally have these worlds out of my head.

## Super Sentai

I've been consuming media related to colorfully costumed heroes piloting giant robots for my entire life. My parents rented videos of old Korean-dubbed Super Sentai shows when I was 7 or 8, and when Power Rangers came out, I was hooked. Flying Warriors was one of my favorite video games growing up. And as an adult, I started watching the more recent Super Sentai series, themed after trains, Indiana Jones-style explorers, and dinosaurs.

My favorite of the new series was the samurai-themed one. Whenever a new sentai series comes out, they take a certain theme and run with it.

I'm aware that Super Sentai tried out a knight themed show a few years ago, but I thought it could have gone even further. Perhaps not quite as far as say *A Song of Ice and Fire*, but further in the themes and elements that make up a medieval fantasy married to a colorful children's show.

## Saga of the Virtuous Knights

Since time immemorial, there has been war between humanity and the demons of the Outer Circles. A thousand years ago, a powerful King, his vassals, and their armies of liege-men launched a Holy Crusade into Pandaemonium, bringing the war to the demons’ own soil. There they established strongholds and fortifications and drove back the demons deeper and deeper until they could go no further. Renouncing their lands in Europa, they took sacred oaths to guard the gates to Hell for eternity.

Over time, humanity forgot this chapter in their history, until only the King and his vassals and their descendants knew the secret and carried on the legacy. Now we reach the twenty-first century, and the new scions of the Virtuous Knights reach their maturity, ready to take on the mantle in defense of humanity!

### Cosmology

The Circles of Creation is the accepted terminology for the cosmos at large. Earth resides in its own circle, briefly touching other Circles periodically at certain points.

The Outer Circles are home to the most depraved beings in the known universe, according to the Virtuous Knights. Any inhabitant who originates from the Outer Circles are named demons or fiends. Within these Circles, the threat of corruption is prevalent, and will turn any mortal into something dark and alien.

### Corruption

The energies of the Outer Circle are so poisonous and caustic that the very presence of demons can cause humans to turn. This can manifest in various ways, including a virulent disease; a mental illness causing those afflicted to act with wild abandon; and others. This Corruption has many different forms, depending on the Circle of origin.

Many facets of the Virtuous Knights’ culture is based on the realities of Corruption. Heirs of virtue spend their youth on Earth before taking on the mantle of Defender of the mortal Realm, in order to delay their exposure to Corruption.

### Recent Events

A quarter century ago, the Virtuous Knights were pushed back from the frontier, with the 75th Red King and many vassals dying in the battle. It was a crushing defeat that had lasting consequences, leading to reform such as the centralisation of power to the Crown as well as the reorganisation of the vassals when deployed to the Outer Circles.
