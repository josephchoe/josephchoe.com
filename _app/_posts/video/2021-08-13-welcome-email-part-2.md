excerpt: In this two-part tutorial sequence, I build upon the earlier event sourcing tutorial and develop welcome emails as a part of the application. Continuing in Part 2, I build a component that will subscribe to the registration component and send welcome emails to users that have registered with the application, even to ones that signed up before the development of this feature.

## Description

In this two-part tutorial sequence, I build upon the earlier event sourcing tutorial and develop welcome emails as a part of the application. Continuing in Part 2, I build a component that will subscribe to the registration component and send welcome emails to users that have registered with the application, even to ones that signed up before the development of this feature.
