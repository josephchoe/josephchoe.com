A little over a year ago, I was forced to move out from my home. I won't go into the details that required me to find a new apartment during the middle of a global pandemic. Suffice to say, I was told to move out in no uncertain terms. No, let's instead turn this back to work, as I so often do with these personal essays.

Let's talk about company loyalty.

Every single company I've worked for likes to say that we're part of a family. Yet, almost inevitably, when push comes to shove, the company never shows any sort of loyalty towards its workers.

Employers will often want their workers to go above and beyond their stated job responsibilities. Working long hours in the software development industry is sadly very much the norm.

But I've never heard of a company going above and beyond for its workers. When moving day came, my company was simply not there for me.

Instead of being supportive, they wanted to know when I would be back at work.

Consider how long it takes to move in ideal conditions. You've already found an apartment. You've hired movers or enlisted friends to help. You've got the electrician on board, ready to turn off and turn on whatever needs to be turned off or turned on.

But when you're moving on a tight time frame, during the middle of a global pandemic no less, these things that can be planned weeks or months beforehand can be incredibly more difficult.

Of course, I tried to tell them all this, but the leadership's contempt was plain to see.
