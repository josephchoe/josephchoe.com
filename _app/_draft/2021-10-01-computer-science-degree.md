I was actually a pretty lousy student.

I used to received pretty consistently high marks. But after a certain point during high school, I lost interest in performing well outside of familial pressures. I coasted through most classes at barely passing grades. This continued on into university.

I was still an intensely curious person, but the things I was curious about and the things I wanted to learn didn't really coincide with what I was studying at school.
