  <p>Over the last few months, perhaps even years, a single thought has loomed before me.</p>

<p>I need to develop my own technology.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about founding a startup or anything like that.
It’s a bit more foundational than that, I think.</p>

<p>Think about the lifecycle of a software developer.
I’m hired at a company, I develop an application or build a product.
I’m generating value.
But when I leave, I take none of that with me.</p>

<p>A lot of the things I build are pretty much the same, company after company.
Sign up users.
Accept payments.
Administrative reports.
That sort of thing.</p>

<p>But I build it over and over again at each new company.</p>

<p>None of this technology I’m building comes with me as I move throughout my career to new projects.
It’s wholly owned by the companies I work for.</p>

<p>That’s what I’d like to change.</p>

<p>I want to build a personal tech stack that I can use for different projects again and again.</p>

<h2 id="the-hyperstack">The Hyperstack!</h2>

<p>So what will I be building?
What programming languages will I use to develop it?</p>

<p>Ruby has served me well in the past.
But I think it’s time I moved onto something else and learn new things.
I’ll still be using Ruby from time to time, but I think it’s best used as a scripting language, rather than for developing applications.</p>

<p>Here’s a shortlist of some things I’d like to learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Elixir</li>
  <li>C Programming</li>
</ul>

<p>Why these specific languages?</p>

<h3 id="elixir">Elixir</h3>

<p>Elixir looks pretty promising.
I’ve already read a ton of material on the language and how to build applications with it.
That doesn’t make me an expert, by any means, but I’m pretty excited!</p>

<p>I’m already familiar with the concurrency model, as I have experience with the Actor model.
Due to the founder’s origins in Ruby, it’s also not too far a leap.</p>

<p>I’d certainly be interested in learning how to deploy applications with this thing, especially on OpenBSD.</p>

<h3 id="c-programming">C Programming</h3>

<p>Something I’ve neglected over my programming life is learning to program in C.</p>

<p>Oh, I know the basics, I suppose.
Loops, control flow, things like that.</p>

<p>But I don’t know how to <em>build</em> whole applications in C.</p>

<p>Likewise, something I’ve never done is learn how to build and develop mobile applications, whether that’s on the iPhone or on Android.</p>

<p>But I’m not really interested in learning Swift or Kotlin.
Instead, I want to explore if it’s possible to build these applications in pure C.
Or some mixture of Objective-C and C, in the case of iOS.</p>

<p>Is it possible?
I have no idea.
But I’d like to learn and find out.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Anywho, that’s what I’ll be devoting my time to over the next year, I think.</p>

<p>Something I’ve been toying with is livecoding and livestreaming the entire thing on YouTube or Twitch.
Or both.</p>

<p>That might be interesting.
Or terrifying.
Or both.</p>
