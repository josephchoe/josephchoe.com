My name is not actually all that rare.

I feel pretty lucky to have parked my name at various social networks. Butr over the years I've heard about these not-so-elusive Joseph Choes. Here is their story.

During the 2016 presidential election, another Joseph Choe gained some notoriety for asking, or trying to ask, a question from Donald Trump. Given that most Joseph Choes I know of are Korean of some stripe or another, things quickly went off the rails, as they are wont to do. He never did get to ask his question, but he sure tried. The only reason I know about this story is because someone linked me to an article on my social media.

A couple of months later, I received a curious email from this Joseph Choe, asking to sell him [josephchoe.com](josephchoe.com), which I'd been parking for quite awhile without actually doing anything with it. He seemed to be very interested in a career in politics and wanted my domain. Given that I had no intention of parting with it for any amount of money, though he never made any sort of monetary offer either, I ignored him.

I moved to Colorado a few years ago, leaving Los Angeles behind.

One day I go to a post office in Denver, when the clerk does a double take at my driver's license. He tells that his daughter used to go to school with me, which is impossible. He asks me if I'm still a lawyer, and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. This was the same Joseph Choe coming to haunt me!
