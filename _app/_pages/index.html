  	Hello!
  </h2>

  <p>
    I develop autonomous, evented services in Ruby. I very occasionally write
    fantasy and science fiction. I try to improve my mind by extensive reading.

  <h2>
    What am I doing now?
  </h2>

  <p>
    I am making software development <a href="{% link _pages/youtube.md %}">video tutorials</a>
    on advanced concepts like event sourcing, software design, and more. Be sure
    to check that out!
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm also developing a work of fiction called <a href="https://theimpossiblechildren.com">The Impossible Children</a>.
    Please take a look if that is something you're interested in.
