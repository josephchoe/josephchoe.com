  <p>This year was a bit of an odd one for me.</p>

<p>One of my goals this year was to develop my personal writing. To do this I pledged privately to myself to write at least once per week.</p>

<p>And to my great surprise, I actually did that. If you go back and look, I’ve written something once a week, usually published on Fridays, for an entire year now.</p>

<p>It’s been an interesting journey, trying to come up with something to write every week. Some weeks I would write ahead early, trying to create a buffer for myself. But I found that my easiest writing came in the days leading up to Friday. When I knew I needed to publish <em>something</em>, my brain just clicked and wrote something out on its own, it seemed like.</p>

<p>Most of the writing wasn’t very good, I’ll admit. Some of it was okay though, and I suppose I couldn’t ask for anything more: that I don’t cringe when I read it again. Here’s actually some of my favorite work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/technical-assessments-are-dumb">Technical Assessments Are Dumb</a></li>
  <li><a href="/better-technical-interview">A Better Technical Interview</a></li>
  <li>Event Sourcing, Parts <a href="/event-sourcing-part-1">1</a>, <a href="/event-sourcing-part-2">2</a>, <a href="/event-sourcing-part-3">3</a>, and <a href="/event-sourcing-part-4">4</a></li>
  <li><a href="/event-sourcing-tutorial">Event Sourcing Tutorial in Ruby</a></li>
  <li><a href="/rack-the-best-ruby-web-framework">Rack - The BEST Ruby Web Framework</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As for next year, I’ll probably take a break from this weekly schedule, as it’s not something I can sustain long term. It was a nice experiment for the year 2021, though I still have a few ideas to explore, and I may even turn out the odd video.</p>

<h2 id="in-the-new-year">In the New Year</h2>

<p>I have a few aspirations for the new year. I hesitate to call them resolutions, because I’ve never done well with those. I like that 2021 was the year I took writing a bit more seriously. For this year, I think I want to try new things that put me a bit out of my comfort zone.</p>

<p>Something else I’d like to do is to begin using <a href="/framework">my new Framework</a> as my daily driver laptop. It’s been a bit difficult to move away from my MacBook Pro, simply because I’m so used to how I did things there. I’m finding it difficult to adjust to new ways of thinking and new workflows. But I think I’m getting there, and next year is when I plan to put it all into practice.</p>

<p>Another aspiration I have is to learn a new language of some sort. I’ve settled on Mandarin, mostly because my wife speaks it. I’m also going to try to pick up Latin once more. I had taken it when I was in middle school and high school, but I’ve probably forgotten most of it.</p>

<p>Something else I’ve done over this past year is to delve once more into my fiction writing. I used to write a lot more on my own personal fantasy stories, but sometime over the years I stopped, as so often happens. But this year, I’ve managed to keep somewhat to a schedule, if not a weekly schedule. I think there’s just something about my brain that <em>needs</em> a weekly deadline to write.</p>

<p>In any case, I’m writing a story called <a href="/impossible-children">The Impossible Children</a>. It’s a middle grade <strong>portal fantasy</strong> about a young girl on an adventure through many different worlds. I may talk about it here a bit more in the future, but in the meantime, you can catch a new chapter every week, or as often as I can do every week.</p>
